Training and validating a SVM image classifier

1. Data collection:
	We can use chrome extension, FatKun to download images of required sports celebrities from google search without web scrapping.

2. Data Cleaning:
	%matplotlib inline is used to makes the plots generated by matplotlib to show into the IPython shell that we are running and not in a separate output window.
	
  First we use openCV and its algorithm Haar cascade which will detect face having two eyes. It has 3 features with edge feature is used to detect eye and cheek region as humans have darker eye region compared to cheeks and line feature to detect 2 eyes and nose bridge.

	While data cleaning, 90% of steps are done in automated way while remaining is done manually on training set. If we have image of target with another person, we will manually reject it to train model properly.
 
 3. Feature Engineering:
	Cropped raw image stacked on to wavelet form of image is used to extract various facial features such as eyes, nose, lips etc
  
 4. Model Training:
  A image classifier on SVM model is trained which resulted as best after validating it with different models with different parameters using GridSearch.
